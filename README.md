# My Awesome History Cleaner (WXT + React)

## üöÄ Overview

**My Awesome History Cleaner** is a powerful and intuitive Chrome extension designed to help you maintain your Browse privacy and declutter your history. Built with `WXT` and `React.js`, this extension provides advanced tools to automatically or selectively delete specific types of URLs from your Browse history, ensuring a cleaner and more organized digital footprint.

Leveraging the Chrome History API, it empowers users with granular control, allowing them to define patterns (e.g., using regular expressions) for URLs they wish to remove, enhancing privacy and performance.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Regex-based URL Deletion:** Define custom regular expressions to match and delete specific categories of URLs (e.g., social media feeds, search queries, unwanted domains).
* **Selective History Cleaning:** Manually trigger deletions based on your defined rules or custom criteria.
* **Automated Cleaning:** Automatically cleans up your history in the background.
* **Intuitive User Interface:** A clean and responsive pop-up and options page built with React.js for easy configuration.
* **Persistent Settings:** Your cleaning preferences and rules are saved using `chrome.storage`, so you only set them once.
* **Privacy Focused:** Gives you control over what gets saved and what gets removed from your Browse history.

This extension requires the following permissions for its core functionality:

* **`history`**: To access, read, and modify your Browse history (e.g., to delete specific URLs).
